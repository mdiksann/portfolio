# Deploy Watcher - Product Requirements Document

**Status:** Ready for implementation  
**Owner:** Platform Engineering  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Target:** Single workspace deployment observability MVP

## Product statement
Deploy Watcher receives CI/CD provider events and presents one normalized deployment timeline with status, checks, failure context, and alerting. It observes deployments; it never starts, retries, or changes a provider pipeline.

## Users, problem, and goals
Developers lose time switching between provider dashboards during a failed release. A **developer** investigates deployments, an **engineering manager** monitors delivery health, and an **admin** configures provider connections and alerts. The MVP target is p95 webhook acknowledgement below one second and p95 event-to-dashboard delay below ten seconds.

## Scope
Support GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Vercel, Netlify, and AWS CodePipeline. Include webhook ingestion, status normalization, deployment detail, filtered history, sanitized log excerpts, and Slack/email notifications. Exclude credential-based polling, triggering deployments, full log archival, and incident management workflows.

## Functional requirements
- **DEP-01:** `POST /webhooks/:provider` validates the provider signature before accepting an event; invalid signatures return 401 and are not persisted as deployments.
- **DEP-02:** The handler records raw payload metadata and enqueues a job using `{provider, providerEventId}` as an idempotency key. Duplicate delivery must produce exactly one normalized event.
- **DEP-03:** Normalize provider states into `queued`, `running`, `success`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `unknown`. Preserve original state and provider URL.
- **DEP-04:** A deployment contains repository, branch, commit SHA, environment, actor, started/finished timestamps, duration, status, and a provider deep link.
- **DEP-05:** `GET /api/deployments` filters by repository, branch, environment, provider, status, actor, and time range; results paginate by cursor.
- **DEP-06:** `GET /api/deployments/:id` returns deployment details, ordered checks, sanitized failure summary, and up to 200 most recent log lines.
- **DEP-07:** Redact values matching configured secret names and token/password/private-key patterns before logs are stored or returned. Raw logs are not retained in MVP.
- **DEP-08:** Admins create notification rules by repository/environment/status. A failed event sends one alert, while a later success sends a recovery notification.
- **DEP-09:** Failed parsing enters a dead-letter table with error, retry count, and raw payload reference; admins can reprocess a single item.

## Architecture and data
Run an HTTP ingestion service plus a Go worker. SQLite is acceptable locally; production schema targets PostgreSQL. Tables: `provider_connections`, `repositories`, `webhook_events`, `deployments`, `deployment_checks`, `log_excerpts`, `notification_rules`, `notification_deliveries`, and `dead_letter_events`. Redis backs the job queue and deduplication locks.

Each adapter implements `verifySignature`, `parseEvent`, and `normalizeState`; adapter fixtures are mandatory. Persist a structured `failure_category` such as `test_failure`, `build_failure`, `deploy_failure`, `cancelled`, or `unknown`.

## Quality, acceptance, and delivery
Secrets are encrypted, RBAC is workspace-scoped, and all logs contain a correlation ID. Retain event metadata 90 days and sanitized excerpts 30 days. The MVP is accepted when fixtures for all six providers pass, duplicate webhooks do not duplicate deployments, a failed provider adapter cannot block another provider, redaction tests cover representative secrets, and a recovery alert is sent once.

Deliver GitHub ingestion and canonical model first, then remaining adapters and list UI/API, then logs/notifications, and finally DLQ, load tests, and security review.

## Stitch Prompt 
 Deploy Watcher

  Design a responsive DevOps deployment monitoring application named Deploy Watcher. It aggregates GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI,
  Vercel, Netlify, and AWS CodePipeline deployments. This is an operations console, not a landing page.

  Create: deployment overview, filtered deployment list, deployment detail page, check timeline, sanitized log viewer, provider-connection
  settings, notification-rule editor, and dead-letter event review screen.

  The overview must make failures obvious: status summary, deployment trend, failed repositories, recent deployments, provider health, and
  environment filters. Deployment detail must show repository, branch, commit SHA, actor, duration, environment, normalized status, checks,
  failure category, provider link, and expandable logs. Use status colors consistently: green success, red failure, amber running, gray
  cancelled, muted blue queued.

  Make the layout dense and easy to scan. Use a dark graphite operations theme with off-white text and restrained status colors, monospace
  for commits/logs, sticky filters, compact tables, and clear empty/error/loading states. Use 8px-radius surfaces, Lucide-style icons, no
  gradients, no oversized cards, and a responsive mobile detail layout.
